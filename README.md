# DApp for real estate sales and rentals

### This is the repository of my final degree project, published in February 2022 for the [Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC)](https://www.upc.edu/ca).

  Historically, the real estate sector has been affected by the complexity of its processes, added to a lack of transparency, due to a large number of
  documents and intermediaries participating in these processes.

  Currently, the breaking Blockchain technology opens its way in different sectors, thanks to certain factors it brings, such as transparency,
  immutability and traceability to transactions.

This project aims to create a decentralized web platform, known as a <b>DApp (Decentralized Application)</b> in a blockchain environment, which allows for streamlining bureaucratic processes, removing intermediaries, waiting times and management costs associated with the sale or rental, in addition to bringing users closer to decentralised applications, providing them with good user experience.

To carry out this concept test, an investigation will be carried out within the field of Blockchain technology, studying all its potential and characteristics, where a stack of tools and technologies that are currently in the vanguard will be used, detailing each of them, to then carry out the implementation of the DApp.
